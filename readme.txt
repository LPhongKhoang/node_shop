I. Parsing the body & Handling Cors
  1. "body-parser" can be use alternatively for "express"
  2. "Cors" (Cross Origin Resources Sharing)
    (see in notebook "codelearn")
  3. File upload: (i.e: product creation form ("name" string, "price" number, "product imag" file))
    + Use "multer" to parse form data to Js Object
    + See in code to know "how to using it" or see in the docs "https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer"
